# LLM AI-DetectTextAuthenticity

## Overview
The DetectTextAuthenticity project addresses the challenge of identifying AI-generated text that closely resembles human-authored content. Participants in this competition are tasked with creating a machine learning model proficient in distinguishing between essays written by students and those generated by large language models (LLMs).

## Objectives
The primary objectives include the identification and differentiation of essays authored by students from those produced by LLMs.

## Choice of Model
Our selected model for this task is the Support Vector Machine (SVM), a versatile algorithm renowned for its excellence in classification tasks. Specifically tailored for distinguishing between human and AI-generated text, the SVM is trained on a labeled dataset of essays. This involves diligently examining features extracted from the text using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique, enabling the model to discern patterns and deliver accurate predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8
- NumPy 1.19.5
- pandas 1.2.3
- spaCy (dependency for import spacy)
- scikit-learn 0.24.2 (dependency for from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, StratifiedKFold, GridSearchCV)
- nltk (dependency for import nltk)
- matplotlib (dependency for import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)

## Features
### Data Loading and Exploration:
- Import and load data using Pandas.
- Display a summary of the dataset, including counts of generated and non-generated essays.

### Text Cleaning:
- Utilize spaCy for natural language processing.
- Remove stop words and punctuation from the text data.
- Apply lemmatization to obtain cleaned text.

### Feature Extraction:
- Use TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert cleaned text data into TF-IDF features.
- Set specific parameters like max_features, min_df, max_df, and ngram_range.

### Model Training and Tuning:
- Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using scikit-learn's SVC.
- Utilize GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

### Cross-Validation and Evaluation:
- Use StratifiedKFold for cross-validation.
- Calculate and print the average accuracy.

### Prediction and Submission:
- Apply the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
- Generate a submission file using Pandas.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the DetectTextAuthenticity project utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on TF-IDF features to distinguish between student-written essays and those generated by large language models (LLMs). This initiative addresses concerns in educational settings related to the potential impact of LLMs on student learning, including plagiarism.

By applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we aim to provide an effective solution for identifying AI-generated content. The transparent and accurate nature of our approach contributes to a more authentic educational experience, empowering educators to maintain the integrity of student work.
